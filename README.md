# Hi! I'm Larissa 💚
## Project Assistant 
I am currently in the third semester of my Systems Analysis and Development program at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná (UTFPR-CP). During my studies, I have gained knowledge in development, including programming languages, management, and communication. I have also worked temporarily in the tourism sector, thanks to my fluency in English, intermediary knowledge of Spanish, and communication skills.
I am communicative and proactive, with a strong ability to learn and work in a team. I am eager to grow and have participated as a volunteer mentor in a Hackathon with 200 participants because I love challenging myself and gaining new experiences. Additionally, I had the opportunity to coordinate a teaching project at my university focused on active methodologies aimed at improving education in the current academic landscape.
Currently, I work and study in the IT field, but I am also passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship!
